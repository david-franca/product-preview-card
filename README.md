## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use images depending on the user's screen size.

This way:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1200px)"
    srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
  />
  <source media="(min-width: 375px)" srcset="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" />
  <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="perfume" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

There are many ways to find and use a solution. Mine is not the best. I need to study to find more ways to achieve the same goal.
